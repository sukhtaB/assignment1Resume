## Can I explain what my code does?
My HTML code creates a resume by various sections such as header, about me, skills, experience, and footer.

## What was my coding process?
Firstly I do planning of differnt section how to use them and I use HTML and svg which helps me to execute the HTML structure and I add the content step by step in the sections.

## What challenges did I have?
I got one challenge while using the svg graphics and i get some help from W3School which helps me to do the svg graphics.

## What would I do differently now?
I learned about the image handling and SVG namespace as well as I also learned about the testing within different devices for responsives.
